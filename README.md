# MailDucky

## What is it?
Mailducky is an unencrypted pop3 and smtp server that gets and sends emails via pop3 over Microsoft Graph.

## BUT WHY???
Because of bad legacy software we'll need a pop3 server that gets emails from office 365 after o365 cancels Basic Auth.

## Should I use it?
No, its not a finished product and there are serious security concerns

## How to start?

Build MailDucky.Service
